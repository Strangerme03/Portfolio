      <p className="text">
       I’m a passionate and self-driven web developer with hands-on experience building full-stack applications using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). My work combines functionality with intuitive UI/UX design to deliver user-centric web solutions.

I’ve developed real-world projects such as a Birth Registration System for secure record management and an e-commerce platform for SBS Optics, complete with product filtering, shopping cart, and admin dashboards.<br/>

I enjoy turning ideas into interactive web experiences from dynamic frontend interfaces to robust backend logic and I’m constantly exploring modern tools and technologies to improve my craft.
